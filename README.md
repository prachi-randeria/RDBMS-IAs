# About the Paper
By comparing and analyzingthe characteristics of an object-oriented database and RDF(S), this paper proposes an approach for mapping object-oriented database models into RDF(S). After giving the formal definitions of object-oriented database and RDF(S), a mapping approach from object-oriented database models to RDF(S) is proposed. Further, a mapping example is provided to show that the approach is feasible, and the analyses and discussions about the approach are done. Finally, the correspondence between object-oriented database query language and RDF query language SPARQL is given.
