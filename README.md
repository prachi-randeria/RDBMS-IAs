# File Descriptions
ood-rdf-paper.pdf - Scientific paper on "Mapping Object Oriented Database Models to RDFs" by Qiang Tong

IA-1.pptx - Presentation based on understanding of the paper(for IA 1).

OODM.txt - This file contains a sample OOD on Hospital Management.

RDF.txt - According to the rules given in the paper, RDF model for the above OODM is given. 

# About the Paper
By comparing and analyzingthe characteristics of an object-oriented database and RDF(S), this paper proposes an approach for mapping object-oriented database models into RDF(S). After giving the formal definitions of object-oriented database and RDF(S), a mapping approach from object-oriented database models to RDF(S) is proposed. Further, a mapping example is provided to show that the approach is feasible, and the analyses and discussions about the approach are done. Finally, the correspondence between object-oriented database query language and RDF query language SPARQL is given.

# About the Implementation
According to the rules given in the paper, a sample Object Oriented Database Model based on Hospital Management is taken and converted to RDF and stored in "RDF.txt". The OODM is stored in the "OODM.txt" file. Conversion rules can be seen in the paper as well as the presentation. As this is a manual conversion, no coding is done.
